        <h2>About Me</h2>
    
     <p>My name is <em>Maya</em>, I am an <em>interactive media design</em> student with a passion for digital arts and creativity.
     I study at Algonquin College and have been learning about web development, UX/UI design, videography and much more. 
     Lately, it's been  pretty fun when it's not making me want to throw my laptop out the window <abbr title="Laughing Out Loud">lol</abbr>.
      </p>

      <p> I really enjoy educating myself on new things and improving my skills. when im not working on school projects I love spending
     time with my cat Misa. I named my cat Misa inspired by my favourite character in a anime called Death Note. Her playful
     and affectionate characteristic always brightens up my day.

    <h2>Quote That I Like:</h2>
    <p>The Bible says: <q> <sup>17</sup> Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in thr eyes of everyone. 
    <sup>18</sup> If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.
    </q></p>
